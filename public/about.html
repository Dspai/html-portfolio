<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Dhruti, as in "ti" suffixed to "Dhru" ka tara a.k.a Pole star for non-hindi speaking folks. 
   <br>My name means Morale, the shakti/energy within you that helps you to keep marching ahead with valor, no matter what. If you are keen to know more about this Sanskrit term (Dhruti/Dhriti), refer to the 18th chapter of Bhagawad Gita.
</p>

<p>Tough professionally I am a computer engineer, I have been more of a change agent; self-learning, leading & driving the "new thing" across the functions of the IT organization.
<br/>
Be it leading by example for Agile or UX design methodology or Business Analysis or Learning & competency development or be it business transformation to cloud & Analytics (DS/AI).  
</p>

<p>
I am a mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend, volunteer & what not :). <br />
I have a wonderful extended family & many many planned as well as spontaneous get-togethers with them.
I am also lucky to have real friends all over the globe. <br/>
I love sightseeing & being with nature, yoga & vedanta. <br/>
Surrounded by lovely people & a harmonious community, life is just beautiful!  
:)
